/**
 * 4.4.1 Basic electronic signature (XAdES-BES)
 * A Basic Electronic Signature (XAdES-BES) in accordance with
 * the present document will build on a XMLDSIG by incorporating
 * qualifying properties defined in the present specification.
 * They will be added to XMLDSIG within one ds:Object acting as
 * the bag for the whole set of qualifying properties, or by
 * using the mechanism defined in clause 6.3.2 that allows
 * further distribution of the properties.
 * Some properties defined for building up this form will be
 * covered by the signer's signature (signed qualifying
 * information grouped within one new element, SignedProperties,
 * see clause 6.2.1). Other properties will be not covered by
 * the signer's signature (unsigned qualifying information
 * grouped within one new element, UnsignedProperties, see
 * clause 6.2.2).
 * In a XAdES-BES the signature value SHALL be computed in the
 * usual way of XMLDSIG over the data object(s) to be signed
 * and on the whole set of signed properties when present
 * (SignedProperties element).
 * For this form it is mandatory to protect the signing
 * certificate with the signature, in one of the two following
 * ways:
 * - Either incorporating the SigningCertificate signed property;
 *   or
 * - Not incorporating the SigningCertificate but incorporating
 *   the signing certificate within the ds:KeyInfo element and
 *   signing it.
 * A XAdES-BES signature MUST, in consequence, contain at least
 * one of the following elements with the specified contents:
 * - The SigningCertificate signed property. This property
 *   MUST contain the reference and the digest value of the
 *   signing certificate. It MAY contain references and digests
 *   values of other certificates (that MAY form a chain up to
 *   the point of trust). In the case of ambiguities identifying
 *   the actual signer's certificate the applications SHOULD
 *   include the SigningCertificate property.
 * - The ds:KeyInfo element. If SigningCertificate is present
 *   in the signature, no restrictions apply to this element.
 *   If SigningCertificate element is not present in the
 *   signature, then the following restrictions apply:
 *   - the ds:KeyInfo element MUST include a ds:X509Data
 *     containing the signing certificate;
 *   - the ds:KeyInfo element also MAY contain other
 *     certificates forming a chain that MAY reach the point of
 *     trust;
 *   - the ds:SignedInfo element MUST contain a ds:Reference
 *     element referencing ds:KeyInfo, so that the latter is
 *     included in the signature value computation. In this way,
 *     the signing certificate is secured by the signature.
 * By incorporating one of these elements, XAdES-BES prevents
 * the simple substitution of the signer's certificate (see
 * clause 7.2.2).
 * A XAdES-BES signature MAY also contain the following
 * properties:
 * - the SigningTime signed property;
 * - the DataObjectFormat signed property;
 * - the CommitmentTypeIndication signed property;
 * - the SignerRole signed property;
 * - the SignatureProductionPlace signed property;
 * - one or more IndividualDataObjectsTimeStamp or
 *   AllDataObjectTimeStamp signed properties;
 * - one or more CounterSignature unsigned properties.
 * Below follows the structure of the XAdES-BES built by direct
 * incorporation of the qualifying information in the
 * corresponding new XML elements to the XMLDSIG (see clause
 * 6.3.1 for further details). In the example "?" denotes zero
 * or one occurrence; "+" denotes one or more occurrences; and
 * "*" denotes zero or more occurrences.
 * The XML schema definition in clause 5 defines the prefix
 * "ds" for all the XML elements already defined in XMLDSIG,
 * and states that the default namespace is the one defined
 * for the present document. In consequence, in the example
 * of this clause, the elements already defined in XMLDSIG
 * appear with the prefix "ds", whereas the new XML elements
 * defined in the present document appear without prefix.
