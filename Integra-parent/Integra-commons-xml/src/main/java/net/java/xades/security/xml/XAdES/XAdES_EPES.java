4.4.2 Explicit policy electronic signatures (XAdES-EPES)
An Explicit Policy based Electronic Signature (XAdES-EPES) form in accordance with the present document,
extends the definition of an electronic signature to conform to the identified signature policy. A XAdES-EPES builds up
on a XMLDSIG or XAdES-BES forms by incorporating the SignaturePolicyIdentifier element. This signed
property indicates that a signature policy MUST be used for signature validation. It MAY explicitly identify the
signature policy. Other properties may be required by the mandated policy.
Clause 7.2.3 provides details on the specification of SignaturePolicyIdentifier property. Specification of the
actual signature policies is outside the scope of the current document. Further information on signature policies is
provided in TR 102 038 [12].
The structure of the XAdES-EPES (created by direct incorporation of the qualifying information to a XAdES-BES
form) is illustrated below.
        <ds:Signature ID?>
            ...
            <ds:Object>
                <QualifyingProperties>
                    <SignedProperties>
                        <SignedSignatureProperties>
                            (SignaturePolicyIdentifier)
                        </SignedSignatureProperties>
                    </SignedProperties>
                </QualifyingProperties>
            </ds:Object>
        </ds:Signature>-
